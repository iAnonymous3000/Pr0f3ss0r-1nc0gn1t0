&lt;p>I had the incredible opportunity to attend LibrePlanet 2024 in person at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. The energy and enthusiasm of the free software community were palpable throughout the two-day event, creating an atmosphere of collaboration and shared purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A highlight of the conference was meeting Richard Stallman, the pioneer of the free software movement. Our conversation about the future of digital rights and the importance of maintaining free software principles in our rapidly evolving digital landscape was both enlightening and inspiring. It served as a powerful reminder of why we continue to advocate for software freedom.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
