Instead, he broke down the problem to its fundamentals: What are rockets made of? What makes them costly? This approach led SpaceX to revolutionize space travel economics, reducing launch costs by over 90%. This is the power of first principles thinking â€“ the ability to strip away assumptions and rebuild solutions from foundational truths.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
