# Lichess: How the Open Source Community is Revolutionizing Chess

_A deep dive into the world's most popular open-source chess platform, its impact, and how you can be part of its future._

## The Chess Revolution

In 2010, a programmer named [Thibault Duplessis](https://lichess.org/@/thibault) had a simple yet powerful vision: create a chess platform that would be completely free, open-source, and accessible to everyone. Today, that vision has evolved into Lichess (pronounced "lee-chess"), a platform that serves millions of players daily and hosts billions of games annually. The name itself reflects its technical roots: "lila" = **li**chess in Sca**la**.

> "Lichess started as a weekend project. I never imagined it would become what it is today – a platform that makes high-level chess accessible to everyone, everywhere." - Thibault Duplessis, Lichess Founder

## Why Lichess Matters

In a world where most chess platforms lock advanced features behind paywalls, Lichess stands apart with its commitment to being completely free and open source. This isn't just about chess – it's about democratizing access to knowledge and tools that were once available only to elite players.

### The Numbers Tell the Story

## What Makes Lichess Different
