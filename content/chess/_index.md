# Chess Journey

## Overview

As a FIDE Arena Grand Master (AGM), I blend my passion for chess with my expertise in cybersecurity. Currently serving as the Strategic Advisor at NEU Chess Club while pursuing my MS in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University, I bring unique perspectives that bridge strategic thinking between chess and security domains. This intersection reveals powerful frameworks for understanding complex systems, anticipating threats, and developing robust defenses.

## Notable Chess Encounters & Tournament Experience

### Elite Chess Encounters

#### Meeting Garry Kasparov

At the "Beyond Boundaries" event at Northeastern University, I had the privilege of meeting chess legend Garry Kasparov. As NEU Chess Club's strategic advisor, I engaged with Kasparov in a meaningful discussion about digital rights and misinformation, gaining valuable insights about the intersection of technology and critical thinking. We secured a chess board signed by Kasparov for our club.

#### Meeting Vishwanathan Anand

A dream came true when I met five-time World Chess Champion Vishy Anand. His quote resonates deeply with my approach to chess and life: "Chess is like body-building. If you train every day, you stay in top shape. It is the same with your brain â€“ Chess exercises it!" This encounter reinforced my commitment to continuous improvement and mental agility.
