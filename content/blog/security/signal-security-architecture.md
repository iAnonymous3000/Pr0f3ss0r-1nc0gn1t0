## 1. Introduction and Threat Model

The **Signal Protocol**, widely recognized for powering Signal Messenger and other secure messaging apps, is designed to ensure that messages and calls remain confidential and tamper-resistant against a wide range of adversaries.

- **Protected Against**:  
  - Passive and active network adversaries  
  - Server compromises  
  - Retrospective decryption of past messages (with forward secrecy and PQXDH)  
  - Attempts to impersonate users without their private keys

- **Not Protected Against**:  
  - Full device compromise at runtime (e.g., reading decrypted messages from RAM)  
  - Large-scale network blocking  
  - Physical exfiltration of keys from secure hardware

Future-proofing against large-scale quantum adversaries is now part of the threat model, with **PQXDH** ensuring that even if a quantum computer becomes capable of breaking elliptic curve assumptions, the post-quantum KEM layer will preserve message confidentiality.

*Overview of the Signal Protocol threat model, highlighting the distinction between threats it mitigates (e.g., network-level attacks, server compromise) and those out of scope (e.g., active device compromise).*


## 2. Key Security Properties

1. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Only intended recipients can read messages.  
2. **Forward Secrecy**: Compromise of long-term keys does not reveal past messages.  
3. **Post-Compromise Security**: After a device compromise, once keys ratchet forward, future messages remain secure.  
4. **Deniability**: The protocol design prevents creating cryptographic evidence that unequivocally ties messages to a particular identity key.  
5. **Post-Quantum Resistance**: PQXDH ensures future quantum capabilities do not retroactively break current message confidentiality.


## 3. Keys and Identities

- **Identity Keys**: Long-term Curve25519 keys signed via Ed25519.  
- **Signed Prekeys**: Medium-term Curve25519 keys uploaded to the server.  
- **One-Time Prekeys**: Short-lived Curve25519 keys used once per handshake.

**Hardware Security**:  
- **Android**: StrongBox or KeyMaster for hardware-backed keys  
- **iOS**: Secure Enclave for private key operations  
- **Desktop**: OS-level secure storage and memory isolation

Keys are never stored in plaintext if hardware support is present. Ephemeral private keys and intermediate values are zeroized after use, helping to prevent compromise by runtime memory inspection.


## 4. Initial Session Setup (X3DH)

**X3DH** (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) establishes a shared secret without prior contact. It combines multiple Diffie-Hellman operations (DH1–DH4) that feed into an HKDF to derive a root key. Historically, X3DH relies solely on elliptic curve assumptions (X25519).

![Signal Protocol Session Establishment (X3DH + PQXDH)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a24c83ed-3342-4e39-89e6-8263bfe16f91)

*X3DH and PQXDH combined handshake flow. The classical X3DH components (left) provide immediate security while the PQXDH addition (right) provides quantum resistance. Both feed secrets into HKDF to derive the Double Ratchet’s root key.*


## 5. PQXDH: Introducing Post-Quantum Resistance

### Rationale

X3DH’s classical security may be broken in a future where quantum computers can crack elliptic curve cryptography. **PQXDH** pairs X25519 with a post-quantum KEM (e.g., [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/)) to achieve **hybrid security**, meaning an adversary must defeat both the classical ECC layer and the post-quantum layer simultaneously.

### Mechanism

1. **Classical Part**: X25519 ECDH  
2. **Post-Quantum Part**: Kyber KEM (though alternative PQ KEMs such as SABER or Classic McEliece may be considered in future)

Both secrets are combined via HKDF, so breaking security requires simultaneously defeating both ECC and PQ layers—significantly raising the bar for attackers.

### Performance

Internal benchmarks show **PQXDH** adds only ~1–3ms to the handshake on mobile devices. On desktop platforms with hardware acceleration, overhead is negligible. Future improvements to PQC algorithms and optimized code may further reduce these costs.

### Migration

PQXDH is introduced in a phased approach:
- **Silent Adoption**: Clients with PQ capabilities silently generate and exchange PQ prekeys.  
- **Gradual Enforcement**: Once a critical mass of clients and server infrastructure support PQXDH, it becomes mandatory for all new sessions.


## 6. Double Ratchet: Detailed State Machine and Error Handling

After the initial handshake (X3DH or PQXDH), the **Double Ratchet** manages continuous re-keying and secure forward secrecy:

1. **DH Ratchet**: Each new ephemeral public key triggers a fresh shared secret (with the recipient’s ephemeral public key), which is combined via HKDF.  
2. **Symmetric Ratchet**: Evolves for each message sent or received, generating unique message keys.

Robust error handling is critical:
- **Out-of-Order Messages**: The protocol can handle missing or delayed messages by advancing the ratchet state.  
- **Session Resets**: If states fall hopelessly out of sync, a new PQXDH handshake re-establishes session security.

![Double Ratchet Protocol: Complete Key Derivation Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6efe4c-de69-4099-a182-7a0b468f171c)

*The Double Ratchet protocol uses DH and symmetric ratchets for forward secrecy and post-compromise security. Each message key is used once and never reused, ensuring old traffic cannot be decrypted if new keys are compromised.*


## 7. Message Encryption Internals

- **Ciphers**: AES-256-CTR or ChaCha20 for encryption; HMAC-SHA256 for authenticity.  
- **Message Format**: Includes version information, ephemeral keys, counters, ciphertext, and HMAC tags. Minimal padding is used; future releases may expand length-hiding strategies to counter traffic analysis.  
- **Ephemeral Key Usage**: Ephemeral message keys generated by the Double Ratchet are never reused across sessions or devices.


## 8. Secure Memory Management

**Memory Hardening**:
- Immediate zeroization of keys after use to reduce exposure in memory dumps.  
- Hardware-backed keystores on supported platforms to store long-term or medium-term keys securely.  
- Minimizing plaintext key presence in RAM wherever possible.  
- **Rust `libsignal-client`** for memory safety at the language level and fewer low-level buffer overflows.


## 9. Group Messaging (Sender Keys and Group V2)

- **Sender Keys**: A single symmetric key per group, with each sender using a **Sender Signing Key** for authenticity. This reduces overhead compared to individually encrypting messages for each recipient.  
- **Group V2**: Maintains membership consistency, ensuring no stealthy additions or removals. Future research includes **post-quantum hardening** of group operations and further metadata reduction techniques.


## 10. Calls and Real-Time Media Encryption

Calls use **DTLS + SRTP**:
- **DTLS**: Ephemeral ECDHE-based key agreement (upgradable to PQ in the future) establishes the session keys.  
- **SRTP**: Secures the real-time media streams with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.  
- **Key Discard**: Once the call ends, keys are discarded, ensuring no long-term correlation of voice/video data.


## 11. Metadata Minimization, Sealed Sender, and Wire Formats

- **Sealed Sender**: Conceals the sender’s identity from the server by encrypting metadata with the recipient’s identity key.  
- **Transport Security**:  
  - TLS 1.3 with pinned certificates  
  - Ongoing research into private contact discovery, domain fronting, and censorship circumvention  
- **Wire Formats**: Minimal metadata is included in transport packets, reducing potential for traffic analysis.


## 12. Formal Verification and Security Audits

**Tools**: [ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/) and [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/) for cryptographic protocol modeling.

- **Double Ratchet Models**: Confirm forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and authentication properties under standard cryptographic assumptions.  
- **PQXDH Models**: Indicate strong resistance to active attackers, reinforcing the hybrid approach’s resilience.  
- **Group Protocols**: Remain an active research area for proofs of membership consistency and post-quantum security at scale.

Independent audits (both internal and external) plus academic research have consistently validated the protocol’s security goals. *Recent proofs even confirm no attacker can break forward secrecy under widely accepted assumptions.*


## 13. Implementation Verification

A combination of testing methodologies ensures correctness and robustness:

- **Fuzzing**: Detects parsing, memory safety, and state machine vulnerabilities by bombarding the protocol with malformed or random inputs.  
- **Property-Based Testing**: Checks invariant properties (e.g., no key reuse, correct ratchet progression, correct ephemeral key rotation).  
- **Integration Testing**: Validates interoperability across various devices (mobile, desktop, server) and PQXDH backward compatibility.


## 14. Security Boundaries and Attack Trees

**Threat Modeling**: Attack trees illuminate potential vectors such as:
- **Server Compromise**: Mitigated by end-to-end encryption, sealed sender, and ephemeral keys.  
- **Network MITM Attacks**: Thwarted by authenticated key exchanges (X3DH, PQXDH) and pinned TLS.  
- **Device Extractions**: Hardware security modules protect long-term keys; ephemeral keys are zeroized quickly.
  

## 15. Performance Considerations and Benchmarks

Despite the added **PQ layer**, the performance impact is manageable:
- **Mobile**: ~1–3ms extra for PQXDH handshakes.  
- **Desktop**: Negligible overhead with hardware acceleration.  

Group messaging and message-level operations remain efficient. As PQC algorithms mature, these overheads may drop further.


## 16. Known Implementation Issues, Pitfalls, and Mitigations

1. **Incomplete Key Zeroization**: Failing to overwrite memory can leak secrets.  
2. **Out-of-Order Message Handling**: The Double Ratchet must gracefully handle skipped or delayed messages; improper handling can break sessions.  
3. **Platform-Specific Nuances**: iOS, Android, and desktop OSes have different APIs for secure storage.  

Mitigations include rigorous code reviews, test harnesses for edge cases, and platform-specific checklists.


## 17. User Verification and Safety Numbers

**Safety Numbers** and QR codes give users a simple, out-of-band way to confirm identity keys. If keys change unexpectedly (e.g., new device or potential MITM attempt), the app warns users. This system extends to multi-device contexts, although users should re-verify each device to maintain trust consistency.


## 18. Multi-Device Security

Signal supports multiple linked devices:

- **Per-Device Identity Keys**: Each device maintains its own ratchet state, so compromising one device does not endanger all past messages or other devices.  
- **Session Synchronization**: Double Ratchet states and PQXDH handshakes automatically extend to new devices.  
- **User Verification Across Devices**: Safety Numbers and user prompts ensure that newly added devices do not silently replace an existing identity.

*The multi-device architecture for Signal. Each linked device maintains its own state, preserving forward secrecy. The key distribution server helps register device identity keys but does not have message access.*


## 19. Ephemeral Messages and Cryptographic Deletion

Ephemeral (disappearing) messages auto-delete after a set interval. While forward secrecy prevents decrypting old messages once ratchets advance, recipients can always screenshot or record content prior to deletion. Future enhancements may integrate ephemeral messaging with encrypted backup policies to reduce risk of indefinite retention.


## 20. Supply Chain Security and Reproducible Builds

**Implementation integrity** is crucial:

- **Open Source**: The Signal Protocol code is entirely public on [GitHub](https://github.com/signalapp).  
- **Dependency Management**: Strict auditing of libraries, especially cryptographic ones.  
- **Reproducible Builds**: Publicly released binaries can be verified to match the source, reducing the risk of supply chain tampering.

![Signal Supply Chain Security](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72d87f5a-61e4-4b5d-b3dd-737e1985938a)

*Comprehensive build and verification pipeline for Signal. Multiple steps—from source code review to final distribution—ensure that no hidden changes can be introduced without being detected.*


## 21. Backup and Key Export Procedures

**Backup Mechanisms**:
- **Encrypted Backups**: On mobile, backups are encrypted with a user-chosen passphrase.  
- **No Plaintext Cloud Storage**: All data remains encrypted client-side.  
- **Migration to New Devices**: PQXDH ensures a secure handshake for session transitions, allowing old devices to transfer or synchronize state without exposing plaintext keys.


## 22. Interaction with Emerging Standards (MLS)

**Messaging Layer Security (MLS)** is a new standard for large-scale, secure group chats. Future work may explore:

- **MLS Integration**: Leveraging MLS’s tree-based group key rotation.  
- **PQ Considerations**: Ensuring MLS can incorporate PQ primitives to complement or replace PQXDH.  
- **Metadata Minimization**: Adapting MLS’s evolving approaches for privacy within bigger groups.


## 23. Side-Channel Resistance and Implementation Security

Beyond correct cryptographic design, robust implementation must address side-channels:

- **Constant-Time Implementations**: Preventing timing or cache-based leaks.  
- **Hardened Crypto Libraries**: Using well-reviewed libraries (e.g., BoringSSL, libsodium).  
- **Regular Audits**: Independent researchers test for side-channel vulnerabilities, especially on mobile platforms where integrated circuits may be more exposed.


## 24. Future Directions

- **Post-Quantum Migration**:  
  - *Short Term*: Hybrid approaches (PQXDH) become standard for new sessions.  
  - *Mid Term*: Evaluate newly standardized PQC algorithms from NIST, possibly adopting them for all protocol components (KEM, signatures, etc.).  
  - *Long Term*: Transition entirely to quantum-safe algorithms once they are validated and widely supported.

- **Metadata Reduction**:  
  Research into privacy-preserving contact discovery, anonymous credentials, and minimizing trust in servers.

- **Formal Verification Expansion**:  
  Extending machine-checked proofs to full-group messaging, ephemeral messaging, and advanced PQ constructs.

- **Continuous Improvement**:  
  The protocol evolves as cryptographic standards mature. We plan to reevaluate these details in mid-2025, once new PQC standards are finalized.


## 25. Conclusion

The **Signal Protocol** sets a high bar for secure messaging. Its well-known features—end-to-end encryption, forward secrecy, and deniability—are now fortified by **post-quantum security** (via PQXDH), **extensive formal verification**, **robust memory management**, and **supply chain integrity** measures. While challenges remain—particularly regarding post-quantum transitions, large-group protocols, and ongoing metadata minimization—the Signal ecosystem is well-positioned to adapt alongside emerging standards like MLS.
