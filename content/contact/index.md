# Secure Communication Channels

I prioritize secure and private communication methods. Below are the only recommended ways to reach me.

## Signal Messenger (Preferred)

For secure, real-time communication:

[Contact via Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/tao35l1vQxmrWcie6iW3dXlcFo0t3Pzae7WFHEMJnAIqKn2WxP5KnKKq5ClE-ZDD)

**Benefits:**
- End-to-end encryption
- Quick response time (typically within 24 hours)
- Enhanced privacy features
- Secure media sharing
- Direct communication channel

## Security Reports

For security-related matters:

1. **Preferred Method**: Use Signal for initial contact
2. **Public Issues**: Submit via [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/profincognito-website/security)

> **Note**: Your privacy and security are paramount. All communication channels are regularly audited and updated to maintain the highest security standards. I do not accept email communications.
