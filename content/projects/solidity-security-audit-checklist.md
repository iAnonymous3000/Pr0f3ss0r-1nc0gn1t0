# Solidity Security Audit Checklist

## Project Overview
A comprehensive checklist and toolkit designed to help developers, auditors, and security researchers identify common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. This resource provides structured guidance for conducting thorough security audits and implementing secure coding practices.

## Why This Matters
Smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses and compromised systems. This checklist helps ensure thorough security reviews by:
- Providing systematic vulnerability assessment guidelines
- Offering practical examples and fixes
- Incorporating lessons learned from past incidents
- Supporting both manual and automated security analysis

## Key Features
Our checklist covers critical security aspects including:
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Arithmetic issues (Overflow/Underflow)
- Access control vulnerabilities
- Input validation and sanitization
- Randomness and timestamp dependence
- Front-running and MEV considerations
- Flash loan attack vectors
- Cross-chain vulnerabilities
- Gas optimization
