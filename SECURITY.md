# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **Do Not Create a Public Issue:**  
   Avoid disclosing the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed. This helps prevent malicious exploitation.

2. **Contact Us Directly:**  
   Reach out via our designated security contact methods:
   - **Website:** [https://profincognito.me/contact](https://profincognito.me/contact)  

3. **Provide Detailed Information:**  
   When reporting, include the following details to help us understand and address the issue effectively:
   - **Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.  
   - **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps that can be followed to replicate the issue.  
   - **Proof of Concept:** If possible, include proof-of-concept code or screenshots to illustrate the issue.  
   - **Impact Assessment:** Information about the potential impact of the vulnerability.  
   - **Affected Components:** Specify which parts of the project are affected.  

4. **Acknowledgment:**  
   We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and strive to resolve critical issues within 30 days, wherever feasible.  

5. **Resolution:**  
   Once the vulnerability is addressed, we will notify you of the resolution and ensure proper credit is given if requested.

## Security Updates

When a vulnerability is identified, we commit to the following actions:

1. **Assessment:**  
   Evaluate the severity and impact of the vulnerability.  

2. **Notification:**  
   Inform all affected users and contributors about the vulnerability and the steps being taken to address it.  

3. **Patch Development:**  
   Develop and test a fix or provide a workaround as necessary.  

4. **Release:**  
   Deploy the security update promptly and communicate details about the resolution.

## Security Practices

We follow best practices to ensure the security and integrity of our project:

- **Code Reviews:**  
  All contributions undergo thorough code reviews to identify potential security issues.  

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Dependencies are regularly updated using Dependabot to incorporate security patches and improvements.  

- **Automated Testing:**  
  Utilize CodeQL and other static analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities and enforce coding standards.  

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Implement CI/CD pipelines that include security checks to prevent vulnerabilities from being merged.  

- **Access Control:**  
  Restrict repository access to trusted contributors and regularly audit permissions.  

- **Secret Scanning:**  
  Monitor and prevent the accidental inclusion of secrets in the repository using GitHub's Secret Scanning.  

- **Frequency:**  
  Security scans are run at least weekly or with every code change to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and addressed promptly.

## Security Tools

We employ the following tools to enhance our security posture:

- **Dependabot:**  
  [Dependabot Alerts](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/dependabot) notify us when dependencies have vulnerabilities.  

- **Code Scanning:**  
  [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) and other static analysis tools automatically detect vulnerabilities and coding errors.  

- **Secret Scanning:**  
  GitHub's [Secret Scanning](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/secret-scanning) identifies and prevents the exposure of sensitive information.  

- **Security Advisories:**  
  We use GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/advisories) to privately discuss and resolve vulnerabilities.


## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. By following the reporting guidelines outlined above, you help us maintain a secure project environment for all users. Proper credit will be given to researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, upon their request, in our release notes or advisories.
