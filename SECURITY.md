## Security Practices

We follow best practices to ensure the security and integrity of our project:

- **Code Reviews:**  
  All contributions undergo thorough code reviews to identify potential security issues.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Regularly update dependencies using Dependabot to incorporate security patches and improvements.

- **Automated Testing:**  
  Utilize Code Scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities and enforce coding standards.

- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Implement CI/CD pipelines that include security checks to prevent vulnerabilities from being merged.

- **Access Control:**  
  Restrict repository access to trusted contributors and regularly audit permissions.

- **Secret Scanning:**  
  Monitor and prevent the accidental inclusion of secrets in the repository using GitHub's Secret Scanning.

## Security Tools

We employ the following tools to enhance our security posture:

- **Dependabot:**  
  [Dependabot Alerts](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/dependabot) are enabled to notify us when dependencies have vulnerabilities.

- **Code Scanning:**  
  [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) and other static analysis tools are integrated to automatically detect vulnerabilities and coding errors.

- **Secret Scanning:**  
  GitHub's [Secret Scanning](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/secret-scanning) is enabled to identify and prevent the exposure of sensitive information.

- **Security Advisories:**  
  We utilize GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/iAnonymous3000/Pr0f3ss0r-1nc0gn1t0/security/advisories) to privately discuss and fix vulnerabilities.
